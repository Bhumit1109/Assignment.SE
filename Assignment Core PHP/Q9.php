<!-- What will be the values of $a and $b after the code below is executed?
Explain your answer. -->

<!-- <?php

$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b";

echo $a;
echo $b;

?> -->

<!-- The Values of $a and $b after the code is executed is 21. Because,
$a = '1';: $a is assigned the string value "1".
$b = &$a;: $b is assigned a reference to $a. This means that $b is not a copy of $a, but rather an alias for $a. Any changes to $b will affect $a and vice versa.
$b = "2$b";: The expression "2$b" is evaluated, which means concatenating the string "2" with the value of $b.
Since $b is a reference to $a, the value of $a is used, which is "1". So, the resulting string is "21".
Assigning a new value to $b also updates the value of $a. So, $a becomes "21".
Finally, $b is also updated to "21", since it's a reference to $a. -->
